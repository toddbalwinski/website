  <div className="prose prose-lg text-slate-700 [&>p]:mb-8">
        <p>When I first joined the Trigon Engineering Society in my first semester at UVA, I was introduced to its three pillars: social, brotherhood, and service. All three have value, but I quickly came to believe that service was the most vital. Social events and brotherhood activities build friendships and trust within the group. Service connects us to the broader community, grounds us in purpose, and allows us to give back to the people and institutions that shape our time at the university.</p>

          <div className="md:w-1/2">
            <p>Despite this belief, I quickly realized that our service culture had faded. Historically, Trigon had been known for major contributions to the engineering school and community. We had organized engineering school tours, sponsored scholarships, donated calculators, run the Engineers Ball, and been honored by the university with both the endowment of a Lawn room and a plaque outside Thornton Hall. By the time I joined, these traditions had dwindled to one modest service event per semester, almost entirely attended by first-years. Upperclassmen, while active in other areas of Trigon, were absent from service. The only remaining event with a sense of prestige was the Thomas E. Hutchinson Award, where we honored an outstanding professor in a formal Rotunda dinner. This event was inspiring, but it also underscored how far we had drifted from our past impact.</p>

        <p>This situation did not sit well with me. I felt that if we wanted to keep the honors gifted by past generations, we needed to live up to them. Service could also solve another problem I noticed: members on the fringes of the group who rarely engaged might be drawn in by a meaningful cause. I decided to run for Vice President, the officer responsible for leading service efforts, on a platform that was clear about my intentions. I promised to revive our culture of service and would not shy away from persistently asking members to participate.</p>

        <p>Winning the election was just the first step. My original goal was to establish a weekly recurring service partnership that could become a fixture of our calendar. When this plan did not come together, I pivoted to building a schedule of annual and one-time events that could still create connection and involvement.</p>

            <p>I started with the Habitat for Humanity Rake-a-Thon. Knowing that turnout had been a challenge in the past, I made sure to open sign-ups early and promote the event at every weekly meeting. This effort paid off, and we fielded a strong team. On the day of the event, we joined other volunteers to rake lawns for Charlottesville residents, raising funds to support Habitatâ€™s work. It was a chance for members to work side by side outside of our usual social context, and it gave us a shared sense of accomplishment.</p>

        <p>We also participated in the Boo Bash at the Virginia Discovery Museum, an event that had been passed down from the previous year. While it was a smaller commitment, it brought members together in a lighthearted setting, interacting with children and helping run Halloween-themed activities. Keeping this tradition alive ensured we maintained at least one link to the service culture of years past.</p>

        <p>By the end of the semester, over half of our brotherhood had participated in at least one service event, a significant improvement over the previous year. I also tracked attendance meticulously in a central Google Sheet that logged each event, who attended, and participation statistics by class year. This not only allowed me to measure progress but also created a clear record for future vice presidents to build on. The sheet shows 58.21% participation across the brotherhood, with first-years leading the way at 77.27% and upperclassmen making notable gains. The full dataset can be viewed here: Service Event Attendance and Stats.</p>

        <p>Alongside running events, I worked to make these improvements sustainable. Leadership in Trigon changes every semester, which means that without good documentation, progress can be lost in a single transition. I created a dedicated email account for the vice president position and documented every event and contact. I encouraged other executive officers to do the same for their roles so that future leaders would have the tools they needed to succeed.</p>

        <p>Looking back, my time as vice president was defined not by one large event, but by the deliberate rebuilding of a culture. We increased participation, maintained important traditions, and created the beginnings of new ones. The foundation we built that semester will allow service to remain central to Trigon for years to come.</p>
